# AgentSessionizer

**Conversation-level observability, measurement, and export for long-lived AI agents.**

> **Status:** pre-alpha. The conversation model and the Claude Code data mapping are defined and
> evidence-backed, and Phase 1 collection is implemented. The assembler, export and preview are not.

AgentSessionizer assembles fragmented agent telemetry into one durable conversation structure. It
preserves sessions as source provenance, keeps parent and child-agent execution lineages separate,
measures model-message continuity, and projects the same committed snapshot into storage, export and
a local preview.

## Why

Agent runtimes record a single user-visible conversation as many unrelated artifacts — transcripts,
traces, logs, provider request bodies, tool events, subagent metadata. That conversation can outlive
one process, reactivate after a long idle period, and contain several concurrent agent lineages.

Trace-level inspection alone cannot answer: what did the whole conversation do; which input, model
response, tool result or child-agent result led to the next model call; did that call preserve the
previous message history or start a new context; which agents contributed; and what should be
measured, stored and exported as one unit.

## Model

```text
Conversation                          durable identity · ownership boundary
 └ Segment                            activity window · the COMMIT unit
    └ Session                         observed source provenance
       ├ ExecutionStream  main        ordered parent-agent lineage
       │  └ Context epoch × N         model-context lifetime
       │     └ Talk × N               one readable input → run → output
       │        └ Run → Step × N
       └ ExecutionStream  child × N   independent context per child agent
```

Two boundaries carry the design. **Conversation** is the durable aggregation and ownership boundary,
and its identity is supplied — never inferred from a person, an account, or timestamp proximity.
**ExecutionStream** is the ordered continuity boundary; model-message continuity is evaluated within
one stream and one context epoch, never across them.

## Evidence discipline

Nothing is presented as observed unless it was observed.

Every claim carries a qualification (`observed_replayable`, `observed_report_only`, `proposed`,
`unavailable`) and every correlation carries a resolution state (`exact_unique`, `exact_ambiguous`,
`strong_inference`, `unresolved`, `conflict`). An exact identifier with several candidates stays
ambiguous — the assembler never silently chooses one. Where a runtime cannot supply something, the
adapter reports it as `unavailable` rather than approximating it.

## Adapters

| Runtime | Status | Collection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Claude Code](docs/en/adapters/claude-code.md) | collection implemented | local files — no configuration required, and it works on history that already exists |
| Codex | planned | — |
| LangChain / LangGraph | planned | — |

## Quick start

```sh
make build                 # builds ./bin/asz
./bin/asz sources          # list discovered sessions and their sources
./bin/asz collect -once    # land everything currently on disk
```

## Documentation

Official documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/) and is indexed by
[`docs/menu.yml`](docs/menu.yml).

[`design-notes/`](design-notes/) holds working engineering notes — measurements, corrections and open
questions produced while designing against real runtime data. They are deliberately unpolished and
are **not** part of the published documentation.

## Contributing

Early contributions should focus on schemas, privacy-safe fixtures, deterministic assembly,
qualification rules and golden tests. Please avoid adding inferred identities or causal edges that
cannot retain their source evidence and resolution state.
