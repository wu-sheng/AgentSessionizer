# Unified Conversation Model

AgentSessionizer assembles fragmented agent telemetry into one durable conversation structure. This
document defines that structure. It is **runtime-agnostic**: every concept here must be expressible
by any adapter, and no concept assumes a particular agent product. Runtime-specific mappings live
under [Adapters](../adapters/claude-code.md).

## Why a model is needed

Agent runtimes expose traces, logs, transcripts, provider request bodies, tool events and subagent
metadata as separate records. A single user-visible conversation can outlive one process, reactivate
after a long idle period, and contain several concurrent agent execution lineages.

Trace-level inspection alone cannot answer: what did the whole conversation do; which input, model
response, tool result or child-agent result led to the next model call; did that call preserve the
previous message history or start a new context; which agents contributed; and what should be
measured, stored and exported as one unit.

The model answers those by fixing two boundaries:

- **Conversation** is the durable aggregation and ownership boundary.
- **ExecutionStream** is the ordered continuity boundary.

Everything else is defined relative to those two.

## Hierarchy

```text
Conversation                          durable identity · ownership boundary
 └ Segment                            activity window · the COMMIT unit
    └ Session                         observed source provenance
       ├ ExecutionStream  main        ordered parent-agent lineage
       │  └ Context epoch × N         model-context lifetime
       │     └ Talk × N               one readable input → run → output
       │        ├ Input
       │        └ Run                 the agent loop
       │           └ Step × N         the leaves — see "Step layer"
       └ ExecutionStream  child × N   independent context per child agent
          └ Talk (typically 1)
             └ Run → Step × N
```

`Segment` sits above `Session` and **cuts across every stream beneath it**: it is a time window
chosen for commit, not a branch of the stream tree. A segment is committed only once all of its
streams are safe to freeze.

`Context epoch` exists **only where a runtime can reset model context in place**. A stream with no
compaction always has exactly one epoch, and its message history accumulates without interruption.

### Object definitions

| Object | Is | Is **not** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Conversation** | stable semantic branch; the unit of storage, analysis and export | a person, an account, a session, a trace, or a time range |
| **Segment** | independently committable activity window | a turn, a Talk, or a new conversation |
| **Session** | source-runtime context carried as provenance | an agent, a stream, or a conversation |
| **ExecutionStream** | ordered main, child, auxiliary or judge lineage within one session | timestamp order, or a prompt sequence |
| **Context epoch** | the lifetime of one model context within a stream | a token-count threshold |
| **Talk** | one readable input → run → output interaction | an exact provider request |
| **Run** | one agent loop inside a Talk | a single model call |
| **Step** | one observed occurrence inside a run | an inferred event |

### Identity rules

- **Conversation identity is supplied, never inferred.** An adapter reports it, or an application
  supplies it. Grouping by person, account, timestamp proximity or session id is not permitted.
- **A session is provenance, not a grouping key.** One conversation may contain several sessions; a
  session belongs to exactly one conversation.
- **A child agent always creates or continues a distinct execution stream.** It creates a new session
  only when the source runtime explicitly reports a different session identifier. Visual nesting,
  agent identity and timestamps never manufacture a session.
- **A conversation id survives cold reactivation** while its durable identity mapping exists. A TTL
  purge starts a new generation.

## Step layer

Steps are the leaves of the tree — the observed occurrences inside a run. Every step carries its own
provenance and qualification (see below); a step that cannot be observed is reported as unavailable
rather than synthesised.

| Family | Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Message** | `message.external` | input originating outside the agent (typically human) |
| | `message.assistant` | agent output visible to the requester |
| | `message.synthetic` | an assistant-role record **fabricated by the client**, not returned by the provider — connection loss, provider error, quota or auth failure, surfaced inline so the requester sees it |
| **Context** | `context.injection` | material the harness injected into model context — instructions, memory, catalogues, reminders, environment state |
| **Model** | `llm.call` | one provider attempt: ordered input manifest plus response |
| | `thinking` | reasoning content associated with a model response |
| **Tool** | `tool.call` | the agent's request to run a tool |
| | `tool.execution` | the execution itself, with its own timing |
| | `tool.result` | the value returned to the agent |
| **Agent** | `agent.call` | a request to start or continue a child agent |
| | `agent.launch_ack` | acknowledgement that a child started — **not** its result |
| | `agent.output` | the child's final output, owned by the **child** stream |
| | `runtime.notification` | the runtime informing the parent that a child completed |
| **Epoch** | `epoch.boundary` | an explicit model-context reset |
| | `epoch.summary` | the carried-forward summary produced by that reset |
| **Control** | `error.api` | a provider error, with retry state where available |
| | `control.interrupt` | an externally initiated interruption |
| | `control.permission` | a permission decision or mode change |
| | `control.command` | a runtime command invoked in-line |
| | `turn.duration` | a runtime-reported duration for a completed turn |

Four ownership rules govern this layer:

1. **`message.synthetic` must never be counted as agent output.** It carries the assistant role and
   sits in the ordered stream like any response, but no model produced it. Counted as
   `message.assistant` it corrupts output statistics and attributes text to the agent that the agent
   never wrote. It is also positive signal — it marks precisely where a conversation was interrupted
   — so it is separated rather than discarded.
2. **`context.injection` is first-class, not decoration.** Injected material shapes a response as much
   as the human turn does, and in some runtimes it is the *only* record of an input.
3. **`agent.output` belongs to the child stream.** The parent receives a compact boundary that
   *references* the child output; it never absorbs the child's messages or tools. This is what
   prevents duplication when a conversation is rendered or exported.
4. **`agent.launch_ack` is not a result.** For asynchronous delegation the canonical order is
   `agent.call → agent.launch_ack → child stream → agent.output → runtime.notification → parent's
   next llm.call`.

## Model-context continuity

Within one stream and one context epoch, adjacent eligible provider calls are expected to satisfy:

```text
next_request.messages =
      previous_request.messages
    + assistant(previous_response)
    + new_input_messages
```

Four properties of this check matter:

- Comparison is **recursive semantic equality, not byte equality**. Cache annotations migrate between
  requests and must be excluded from the comparison, or the invariant is false on every adjacent pair.
- It applies **within one stream and one epoch only**. Auxiliary, retry and reset transitions are
  excluded, and it never crosses streams.
- An explicit epoch boundary is the **only** admissible evidence of a context reset. It is never
  inferred from token counters or from a prefix mismatch alone.
- The strength of the check depends entirely on the evidence available. Where a runtime exposes the
  serialized request, this verifies what was actually sent. Where it does not, the same equation
  evaluated over a reconstructed message list is a **structural cross-check on the reconstruction**,
  not a statement about the wire. Adapters must report which of the two applies.

## Evidence and qualification

Every material claim, statistic, diagram edge and rendered annotation carries or inherits a
qualification. Nothing is presented as observed execution unless it was observed.

**Claim states**

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `observed_replayable` | derived from retained evidence that can be replayed |
| `observed_report_only` | observed, but the underlying evidence is not retained |
| `proposed` | a design target, not yet produced by an implementation |
| `unavailable` | the source cannot supply it |

**Correlation quality** — every join between two records:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `exact_unique` | an exact identifier match with exactly one candidate |
| `exact_ambiguous` | an exact identifier match with several candidates — **never silently resolved** |
| `strong_inference` | no identifier, but a well-founded structural argument |
| `weak_inference` | plausible only |
| `unresolved` | no usable evidence |
| `conflict` | sources disagree |

An exact identifier does not guarantee a unique match. Where several candidates share a key, the
relation stays `exact_ambiguous` and the assembler must not choose one.

**Content state** — for any referenced payload: `available`, `redacted`, `omitted`, `hash_only`,
`size_only`, `truncated`, `unavailable`.

## Ownership versus causality

The tree carries **direct semantic ownership only**. Every node has at most one containment parent.

Everything else — provider input membership, spawn, asynchronous delivery, retry, join, cancellation
and compaction lineage — is a **sparse typed relation** between nodes, each carrying its own
correlation quality and source references. Cross-stream flow is never expressed as containment.

Display order is a deterministic projection. It does not prove causality, and it must not be used as
evidence for it.

## Adapter contract

An adapter supplies as much of the model as its runtime exposes, and reports the rest as
`unavailable`. It must never invent identity, parentage or causal links.

**Minimum for a useful adapter**

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Conversation identity | explicit; or a documented, stated default mapping |
| Session identity | as observed from the runtime |
| Execution-stream identity | main and child lineages distinguishable |
| Ordered steps | with a stable per-source ordinal |
| Tool call ↔ result join | with correlation quality |
| Child spawn and return | with correlation quality |

**Strongly recommended**

Context-epoch boundaries; ordered provider input manifests; injected-context records; retry and
attempt identity.

An adapter that cannot expose ordered provider input must report model-context coverage as
`unavailable`. Timing and cache counters do not prove model-input membership.

## Non-goals

- Grouping work by human or principal identity.
- Inventing missing model input, sessions, parentage or causal links.
- Re-exporting the original discrete traces and logs as the final product.
- Acting as a general observability backend or product UI.
- Making an unavailable field look like an observed execution-tree node.
