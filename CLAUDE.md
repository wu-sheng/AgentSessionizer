# AgentSessionizer

Conversation-level observability for long-lived AI agents. It assembles fragmented agent
telemetry — transcripts, subagent streams, workflow journals — into one durable conversation
structure.

Two boundaries carry the design: **Conversation** is the durable ownership boundary and its
identity is supplied, never inferred; **ExecutionStream** is the ordered continuity boundary,
within which model-message continuity is evaluated.

Apache-2.0. Personal project, not an ASF project.

## Documentation

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/` | **Official docs.** Indexed by `docs/menu.yml`; SkyWalking layout (`docs/en/...`). |
| `docs/en/concepts-and-designs/unified-conversation-model.md` | The model. Runtime-agnostic — no Claude Code vocabulary belongs here. |
| `docs/en/concepts-and-designs/conversation-assembly.md` | The eight-stage pipeline and the round chain. |
| `docs/en/adapters/claude-code.md` | How Claude Code maps onto the model, and what it cannot supply. |
| `design-notes/` | **Working notes, not documentation.** Measurements, corrections, open questions. Unpolished by intent. |

Every claim in the docs is backed by a measurement against a real corpus. When changing them,
keep that standard: state what was measured, on what sample, and say `unavailable` rather than
approximating.

## Writing

Comments, docs and commit messages use **plain, widely understood English**. Someone reading this
project is often not a native English speaker, and the code is the hard part — the prose should not
be.

- **No abbreviations or slang.** Write "remove duplicate records", not "dedup". Write "configuration",
  not "config", outside identifiers.
- **No unusual or figurative words** where a common one works: use "essential" not "load-bearing",
  "hide" not "launder", "insert" not "splice", "block" not "veto", "cut out" not "amputate".
- **Short sentences.** One idea each. Prefer a period to a dash or a semicolon.
- **Say why, not what.** The code already says what it does. A comment earns its place by recording
  the reason, the measurement, or the failure that forced the choice.

## Structure

```
cmd/asz/                        CLI: sources · collect · index · show · parse · conversation · verify
pkg/record/                     landed envelope — public, adapters produce these
pkg/model/                      the conversation vocabulary: node kinds, relations, qualification
pkg/asb/                        the round chain: frames, writer, reader, fold, chain verification
internal/index/                 derived lookup structure the assembler resolves against
internal/assemble/              the eight-stage pipeline, index in and structure out
internal/parse/                 one round: assemble, compare against the chain, publish the delta
internal/storage/               landing zone, atomic writes, cursors, session/index state, locks
internal/verify/                contiguity and digest checks over landed data
internal/adapters/claudecode/   the claude-code-local adapter
internal/config/                YAML configuration
tests/adapter/claudecode/local/ end-to-end suite over a synthetic fixture corpus
```

`pkg/` is public because third-party adapters and consumers need it. Built-in adapters stay in
`internal/`.

**Phase 1 (implemented):** pull collection from local Claude Code files, plus a derived index built
while landing. No configuration of Claude Code required, and it works on history that already exists.
**Phase 2 (implemented):** assembly into a conversation, published as an append-only chain of
immutable rounds — see `design-notes/02` and the assembly doc.
**Phase 3 (not designed):** export and preview. OTLP push belongs here too; it adds measurement
only, never structure.

## Build

```sh
make build          # -> ./bin/asz
make test           # whole suite, -race
make test-e2e       # only the end-to-end adapter tests, verbose
make check          # vet, lint, license headers, dependency licenses, tests — what CI runs
make help           # all targets
```

Go 1.25+. One dependency: `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`.

Every source file carries the Apache-2.0 header; `make license-fix` inserts missing ones.
`license-eye` is pinned to v0.9.0 — v0.7.0 does not build under Go 1.26.

## Invariants worth knowing before changing assembly code

- **The conversation is the fold of every round.** There is no other state. A round is immutable and
  is never rewritten; later evidence produces a new revision in a later round.
- **Entity ids come from stable evidence, never from position.** An id that shifts when an earlier
  source is backfilled cannot supersede its own earlier revision.
- **A round carries no wall-clock time**, so the same evidence reproduces the same bytes and digest.
  Anything mutable or temporal lives in `conversation.state`, outside every digest.
- **Absence in a round means unchanged, never deleted.** Removal is an explicit tombstone, and a
  resolved reference is superseded with that state rather than dropped.
- **Assembly reads the index, never the payloads.** Structure needs identifiers; text is read only
  when a conversation is rendered.
- **A prompt cycle id is not unique across streams.** Anything keyed on it must be scoped by stream.
- **Never use a stop reason to find a call's last fragment.** A main transcript stamps it on every
  fragment. Line order is the only rule that works on both stream kinds.
- **Cross-stream flow is a relation, never containment.** A child's work stays under the child.

## Invariants worth knowing before changing collector code

- **Landed files are write-once.** temp → fsync → rename → `chmod 0444`. Never appended.
- **Payload bytes are the source bytes**, byte-for-byte. `json.RawMessage` both directions.
- **Land before committing the cursor.** At-least-once is intentional; the reverse loses data.
- **`next_seq` is monotonic across all streams in a session**, so a session is processed
  single-threaded and under a lock. The filesystem is the authority on the counter.
- **Never use `bufio.Scanner` on source records.** Real lines reach ~1 MB, past its 64 KB
  default, where it fails silently.
- **The index is derived and disposable.** Delete it and it rebuilds from landed files; a schema
  bump discards rather than migrates. Nothing downstream may treat it as authoritative.
- **The index stores roles, not runtime field names.** A runtime's vocabulary stops at its adapter,
  so a rename there cannot reach the model. `internal/index` and the model docs must stay free of
  `promptId`, `parentUuid`, `agentId` and their kin.
- **A record type is not what a record is.** A `user` record is usually a tool result, not a human —
  only ~7% are typed by a person. Check `origin` and the content blocks, never `type` alone.
