// Three mechanisms exist and no single field covers all of them, because most
// children carry no pointer back to their parent in their own sidecar file:
//
//	Agent tool   the sidecar names the call that created it, and the parent's
//	             result names the child. The two are redundant, so they check
//	             each other.
//	Skill fork   only the parent's result names the child. The sidecar has no
//	             pointer at all.
//	Workflow     the parent's result names a run, and the run's journal names
//	             each child it starts.
//
// Two cautions, both measured. A completion notification's tool-use id is not
// always resolvable in the file it landed in: a nested child notifies the main
// stream while the call that started it lives in an agent file. Resolution
// therefore searches the whole session, which is why the index keys these
// across streams. And the notification's status element is missing entirely on
// a large class of notifications, so nothing may require it.
