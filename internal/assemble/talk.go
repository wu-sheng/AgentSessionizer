// Stage 7 - build talks and runs.
//
// This stage produces the conversation a person reads, and it has the least
// support from the runtime: neither a Talk nor a Run is something Claude Code
// records. Both are derived, so the rule has to be stated exactly.
//
// A TALK STARTS ONLY ON INPUT FROM OUTSIDE THE AGENT. A background agent
// finishing and the parent picking up again is mechanically a new prompt cycle,
// but nobody said anything - it is the same interaction continuing. Starting a
// Talk on every prompt cycle would break one interaction into as many pieces as
// it delegated work, where a reader sees one. The whole chain of call,
// acknowledgement, child stream, child output, notification and the parent's
// next call lives INSIDE one Talk.
//
// MEMBERSHIP IS RESOLVED BY WALKING BACKWARD, NEVER BY LINE PROXIMITY. Run
// ids sit on trigger records; a model response carries none, but every one
// reaches a run through its containment parents. Proximity would agree in the
// simple case and disagree exactly where it matters - a forked chain, a
// replayed block, an interrupt that reattaches to an earlier record - putting
// records in the wrong turn.
//
// A CHILD STREAM IS EXACTLY ONE TALK: the delegated prompt in, the final output
// out, nobody outside the agent involved. Child streams never reset context, so
// each is also exactly one epoch.
