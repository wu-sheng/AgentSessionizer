// graph is a directed acyclic graph, not a chain: dispatching several tools at
// once forks it, so a forward walk follows one branch and drops the other tool
// use with its result. On tool-bearing calls that produces a message list the
// provider API would itself reject. Walking BACKWARD is fine and stage 7 relies
// on it - a record has exactly one containment parent, so backward is
// single-valued. The ban is on the direction, not on the edge.
//
// Second, group by message id and not by request id. A record the client
// fabricated can carry a real call's request id, so grouping by request id puts
// invented content inside a real provider call.
