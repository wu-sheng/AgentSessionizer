// Package assemble turns a session's derived index into conversation
// structure.
//
// It reads the index, not the payloads. Structure resolution needs identifiers,
// not content: removing duplicate records needs record ids, grouping a provider
// call needs message ids, joining a tool needs tool-use ids, joining a spawn
// needs agent and run ids. None of it reads message text. Payloads are read
// only when the result is rendered, and only for the records that appear in it.
//
// The whole session is assembled every time. That is what makes the output
// reproducible: the same index always produces the same entities, so a round
// can be re-derived rather than only trusted. Assembly resolves against a few
// megabytes of index and takes milliseconds, so rebuilding costs little.
