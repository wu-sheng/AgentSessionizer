// Package parse drives one round of assembly and publishes it to a

// Each round does the same three things: assemble the whole session from the
// index, compare that against what the chain already says, and write only the
// difference. Assembling everything each time is what makes a round
// reproducible - the same index always produces the same entities - and
// comparing before writing is what keeps a round small.
