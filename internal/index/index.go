// Package index holds the derived lookup structure the assembler resolves
// conversation structure against.
//
// The index exists because structure resolution needs identifiers, not content:
// removing duplicate records needs record ids, provider-call grouping needs message ids,
// tool joins need tool-use ids, spawn joins need agent and run ids. None of it
// reads message text. Measured on a real corpus, the index is ~12x smaller than
// the payloads it describes - 16 MB for the largest session, 95 MB for 1.1 GB
// of conversation - which is what lets the whole thing stay resident with
// random access.
//
// It is DERIVED and DISPOSABLE. Deleting it loses nothing; it rebuilds from the
// landed files. Nothing downstream may treat it as authoritative.
