// Dialect names this runtime's vocabulary and the version of the mapping below.
//
// It is separate from the adapter name. `claude-code-local` says how records
// were acquired; this says how they are read. A push receiver for the same
// runtime would be a different adapter and the same dialect.
const Dialect = "claude-code/1"

// glossary is what Claude Code calls the things the model names.
//
// It lives beside the extraction code on purpose. Every entry with a Native
// value corresponds to a field the converter reads, so a rename in the
// runtime changes both together, and a test checks that the model's whole
// vocabulary is accounted for here.
//
// An empty Native is not a gap. A Talk, a Segment, a correlation quality - the
// runtime records none of them, and saying so is more useful than a plausible
// word that would send a reader looking for a field that does not exist.
