// Package sessiondata defines Session Data: what was actually in a
// conversation, in one shape regardless of which agent produced it.
//
// A landed file has the extension .sd. Its first line is a header carrying
// everything constant for the file; every line after it is one record, and a
// record's content is broken into PARTS - a message, a thought, a call, its
// result - using names no runtime owns.
//
// The conversion happens once, while the source is read, and never again. That
// is what keeps a runtime's vocabulary out of everything above: a reader is
// handed parts, so there is no runtime shape for it to reach into. A dialect
// that meets something it cannot describe keeps the bytes verbatim in an
// `unknown` part rather than guessing or dropping them.
