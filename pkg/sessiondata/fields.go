package sessiondata

// Fields says what each field of a landed record means, in one line.
//
// A reader looking at a record should not have to read this package to find
// out what it is looking at, so the format carries its own description. Only
// the envelope is here. A field that names something the model names - a
// stream, a call, a run - is described by the adapter's glossary instead, which
// also says what the runtime calls it.
