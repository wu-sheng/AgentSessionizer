// Entity ids.
//
// An id must be derivable from evidence that does not move. Position is the
// tempting choice and the wrong one: a node keyed by "the 14th record in the
// stream" gets a different key the moment an earlier source is backfilled, and
// a changed key cannot supersede its own earlier revision - the fold would hold
// both, one stale and one current, with no way to tell them apart.
//
// So ids are built from the runtime's own identity for a thing, scoped by
// session and stream. Where the runtime supplies no identity, the id is derived
// from the landed location of the evidence, which is itself immutable once
// written.

// NodeID builds a node id from stable parts.
//
// Parts are joined rather than hashed so an id stays legible in a round file
// and in an error message. Legibility matters more than length here: these are
// read by people debugging why two revisions did not merge.

// revealed it. Two records asserting the same edge are the same relation
// observed twice, and must fold to one - keying by evidence would keep both.
