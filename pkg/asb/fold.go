// View is the materialised result of folding a chain.
//
// It is derived and disposable: nothing here is authoritative, the rounds are.
// Deleting a view and refolding must reproduce it exactly, which is the
// property that lets a view be cached, rebuilt or discarded freely.
type View struct {
	Conversation string
	Session      string

	// Round and Digest identify the last round folded in - a view is always a
	// view AS OF a round, never of "the chain" in general.
	Round      uint64
	Digest     string
	ThroughSeq uint64

	// InputDigest, Parser and Policy are recovered from the last round's own
	// header rather than from any state file.
	//
	// This is what makes recovery correct after a crash between publishing a
	// round and saving state. The rounds are immutable and on disk; the state
	// file is a cache that may be stale, missing, or from a different run. A
	// round built on a stale input digest would break the chain that binds each
	// round to the evidence before it.
	InputDigest string

	// kids is a parent-to-children index, built once on first use and dropped
	// whenever a round is applied.
	//
	// Without it, finding one node's children means scanning every node, so
	// walking a subtree of 42 costs 42 times the whole conversation. Measured on
	// a real 53,106-node session that was 17 ms for a median talk and 432 ms for
	// the largest - which reads as "reading is slow" when it is only "this
	// function was written the obvious way".

// Fold semantics.
//
// Three rules, and each exists because its opposite loses information:
//
//  1. LAST WRITER WINS, per entity id. A later revision of the same id fully
//     replaces the earlier one. It does not merge field-by-field: a partial
//     merge cannot express "this attribute is now absent", so a correction that
//     removes something could never be recorded.
//
//  2. ABSENCE MEANS UNCHANGED. A round carries only what it changed. An entity
//     missing from round 7 is exactly the entity round 4 published. Removal is
//     therefore explicit - a revision with Tombstone set - and never inferred
//     from silence.
//
//  3. ORDER IS CHAIN ORDER, NOT TIMESTAMP ORDER. Rounds fold in round order and
//     entities within a round in file order. Timestamps come from the observed
//     runtime and can go backwards across sources; the chain cannot.
//
// The consequence worth stating plainly: fold(rounds 1..N) is the whole
// definition of the conversation as of round N. There is no other state.

// NewView returns an empty view.
